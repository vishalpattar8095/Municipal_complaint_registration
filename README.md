# Municipal_complaint_registration
Android app
Our Android application is designed to assist the public in reporting issues related to public property to their municipal office efficiently. With our app, users can easily document problems by attaching images or videos to their complaints. Additionally, we provide a convenient option for users to provide a brief description of the issue they are reporting. Our goal is to streamline the process of reporting and addressing concerns related to public property, making it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

**REQIREMENTS**
1. **Operating System**:
   - Windows: Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit required)
   - macOS: macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
   - Linux: Any 64-bit distribution that supports GNOME or KDE desktops

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Android Studio requires a compatible version of the JDK to be installed. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, it's recommended to use OpenJDK.
   - Android Studio 4.2 and higher require JDK 11. You can download OpenJDK 11 from the official OpenJDK website.

3. **Android Studio**:
   - Download the latest version of Android Studio from the official Android Studio website (https://developer.android.com/studio).

4. **RAM**:
   - A minimum of 8GB RAM is recommended for Android app development, although 16GB or more is preferable for a smoother experience, especially for more complex projects.

5. **Disk Space**:
   - Android Studio requires a significant amount of disk space for installation and project files. A minimum of 4GB of disk space is recommended, but you should have more space available for your projects.

6. **Android SDK**:
   - Android Studio includes the Android SDK, but it's a good practice to keep it updated regularly. Android SDK components can be installed and updated using the Android Studio SDK Manager.

7. **Virtualization Technology (for Emulators)**:
   - If you plan to use the Android Emulator for testing, your CPU should support virtualization technology (VT-x/AMD-V) and it should be enabled in your computer's BIOS/UEFI settings. This will significantly improve emulator performance.

8. **Optional: Android Device for Testing**:
   - While not a strict requirement, having a physical Android device for testing is highly recommended. Android Studio allows you to test apps on real devices, which can provide a more accurate representation of how your app will perform in the real world.

Please note that software requirements may change over time as new versions of Android Studio and the Android SDK are released.

**Steps of Installation**
Here are the steps with rewritten instructions:

1. **Install Android Studio - Version Chipmunk 2021.2.1:**
   - Begin by installing Android Studio. Make sure you're using the Chipmunk 2021.2.1 version of Android Studio for optimal compatibility.

2. **Download and Extract the Code:**
   - Next, download the source code for the application and extract the files to your preferred location on your computer.

3. **Open the Project in Android Studio and Sync Gradle Files:**
   - Launch Android Studio and open the project by selecting the folder where you extracted the code.
   - Once the project is open, wait for Android Studio to automatically sync the project with the Gradle files. You can also manually trigger this synchronization if needed.

4. **Run the Application on an Emulator of Your Choice:**
   - To test the application, you can run it on an Android emulator. Android Studio provides various emulator options for different Android device configurations.
   - Select your preferred emulator from the available options and click the "Run" button to start the application on the emulator.
